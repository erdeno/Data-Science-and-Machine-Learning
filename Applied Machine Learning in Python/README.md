# Applied Machine Learning in Python
This course we have been introduced to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods.  We discussed the issue of dimensionality of data, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters. Then we learned supervised approaches for creating predictive models, and we have been able to apply the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). At the end of the course, we looked at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. 


# Assignments

## Fundamentals of Machine Learning - Intro to SciKit Learn
In this module we have been introduced to basic machine learning concepts, tasks, and workflow using an example classification problem based on the K-nearest neighbors method, and implemented using the scikit-learn library.

## Supervised Machine Learning - Part 1
In this module we dived into a wider variety of supervised learning methods for both classification and regression, learned about the connection between model complexity and generalization performance, the importance of proper feature scaling, and how to control model complexity by applying techniques like regularization to avoid overfitting. In addition to k-nearest neighbors, in this module we learned linear regression (least-squares, ridge, lasso, and polynomial regression), logistic regression, support vector machines, the use of cross-validation for model evaluation, and decision trees.

## Evaluation
In this module we have been introduced to evaluation and model selection methods that you can use to help understand and optimize the performance of your machine learning models.

## Supervised Machine Learning - Part 2

In this module we dived more advanced supervised learning methods that include ensembles of trees (random forests, gradient boosted trees), and neural networks (with an optional summary on deep learning). We learned about the critical problem of data leakage in machine learning and how to detect and avoid it.
