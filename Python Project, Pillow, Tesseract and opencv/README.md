# Python Project: pillow, tesseract, and opencv
In this course we made a hands-on project suitable for a portfolio. We have been introduced to third-party APIs and will be shown how to manipulate images using the Python imaging library (pillow), how to apply optical character recognition to images to recognize text (tesseract and py-tesseract), and how to identify faces in images using the popular opencv library. For the final project we worked with three different libraries available for Python 3 to create a real-world data-analysis project.


# Assignments


## The Python Imaging Library

In this assignment, we used the Pillow library. With the Pillow library we created variations on images. We manipulate color channels and created a contact sheet that shows what some of those manipulations look like.


## Computer Vision with OpenCV

In this assignment we have practiced the use of the libraries behind pillow, tesseract, and opencv in python to build a simple search application. In addition, we have learned how to manipulate zip files with a python library.
We took a zip file of images and process them, using a library of python. The files in the ZIP file were newspaper images. And I wrote python code which allows one to search through the images looking for the occurrences of keywords and faces.  This project help me to develop skills to use OpenCV to detect faces, skills to use tesseract to do optical character recognition, and skills to use PIL to composite images together into contact sheets.
