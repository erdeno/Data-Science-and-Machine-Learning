# Introduction to Data Science in Python

In this course we learned to the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. The course introduced us data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, I learned how to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses. 



# Assignments

## Basic Data Processing with Pandas

With this assignment I learn the fundamentals of one of the most important toolkit Python has for data cleaning and processing, "pandas". I experienced how to read in data into DataFrame structures, how to query these structures, and the details about such structures are indexed.

## Advanced Data Processing with Pandas

With this assignment we deepened our understanding of the python pandas library by learning how to merge DataFrames, generate summary tables, group data into logical pieces, and manipulate dates. 

## Answering Questions with Messy Data
With this assignment  we have been introduced to a variety of statistical techniques such a distributions, sampling and t-tests.
