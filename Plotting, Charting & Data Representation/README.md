# Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

In this course we learned to information visualization basics, with a focus on reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. We started to this course with a design and information literacy perspective, touching on what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations. Then we focused on the technology used to make visualizations in python, matplotlib, and introduce users to best practices when creating basic charts and how to realize design decisions in the framework. After that we have been introduced of functionality available in matplotlib, and demonstrate a variety of basic statistical charts.



# Assignments

## Basic Charting
In this module, we introduced to basic charting. For this assignment, we worked with real world CSV weather data. We manipulated the data to display the minimum and maximum temperature for a range of dates and demonstrate that how to create a line graph using matplotlib. Additionally, we demonstrated the procedure of composite charts, by overlaying a scatter plot of record breaking data for a given year.

## Charting Fundamentals

In this module we explored the charting fundamentals. For this assignment we worked to implement a new visualization technique based on academic research. 

## Applied Visualizations
In this module, then everything starts to come together. This assignment requires that you identify at least two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension. We stated a research question that can be answered using these data sets and then we created a visual using matplotlib that addresses our stated research question.
